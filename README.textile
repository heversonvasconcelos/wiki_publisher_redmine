Redmine Wiki Publisher uses wiki macros that are not recognized by Redmine by default.
The repo_include macro used is from another plugin, "Redmine SCMacros":https://github.com/gpr/redmine_scmacros
This macro includes a file from repository (svn, git, etc) in the project wiki.
Example:
<pre>
{{repo_include(design/gpr/index.textile)}}
</pre>

This plugin was developed using Redmine 1.3.2 and it was not tested with another version.
For while, the only SCM supported is Subversion SVN.
